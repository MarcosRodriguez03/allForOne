all for one
made a website that has all the mini challenges

peer reviewer - Jared Ly
peer review - 
Loved how the code worked and the solid colors for backgrounds! 
Looking at your pages it was hard to tell which page was which as they were just numbered but thats just me. 
Something you need to change though is the spelling for reverse it and reverse it numbers as you spelt it reserve it (lol)
Also you should swap the next button and the back button for mobile because it was confusing and I kept going back, this would make your site a little more user friendly.
Other than that you did very well good work!
